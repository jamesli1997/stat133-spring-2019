## Introduction

Sooner or later you will need to manipulate files from the command line: it could be `Rmd` files, `R` script files, image files, data files, etc. In this tutorial, we'll see new ways to manipulate data table files with shell commands and pipelines.


## Crash Example

Let's get our feet wet with a working example. The first thing you'll need to do is create a directory for this tutorial:

```bash
mkdir pipes
cd pipes
```

Download the file `nba2017-players.csv` from the course github repository, and then invoke `ls` to check that the data file was successfully downloaded.
:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-spring-2018/master/data/nba2017-players.csv

ls
```

Now that you have a data file, you can apply the basic commands that we've used in lab for inspecting the file's contents. Here's a table with some of those commands, as well as functions in R that have a similar use:


| Command                     | Description                   | R alternative             |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `wc nba2017-players.csv`    | count lines, words, and bytes | `object.size()`, `nrow()` |
| `wc -l nba2017-players.csv` | count number of lines         | `nrow()`                  |
| `head nba2017-players.csv`  | inspect first 10 rows         | `head()`                  |
| `tail nba2017-players.csv`  | inspect last 10 rows          | `tail()`                  |
| `less nba2017-players.csv`  | see contents with a paginator | `View()`                  |


In addition to these inspection-oriented commands, you can also use other unix tools to carry out common manipulation of data tables: select rows and columns, sort information, determine frequencies, find unique values, etc.


### Redirecting output to a new file with `>`

For demo purposes, let's subset the data file `nba2017-players.csv` by taking the first 11 rows:

```{bash}
head -n 11 nba2017-players.csv
```

Instead of displaying output on the screen, we can use the output redirection operator `>` to a new file:

```{bash}
# redirection to new file
head -n 11 nba2017-players.csv > data10.csv
```

You can use `cat` to check that `data10.csv` contains the column names, and the firts 10 lines of data:

```{bash}
# display contents on screen
cat data10.csv
```


### Selecting columns with `cut`

How do we select a specific column, say `position`, from `data10.csv`? We can use the `cut` command for this purpose, using the flag `-d ","` to specify the field-delimiter, and the flag `-f 3` to indicate that we want to extract the third column:

```{bash}
# select third column
cut -d "," -f 3 data10.csv
```

In the same way we created `data10.csv`, we can redirect the output of `cut` to a new file `positions10.txt`

```{bash}
# positions (first attempt)
cut -d "," -f 3 data10.csv > positions10.txt

cat positions10.txt
```


### Sorting lines with `sort`

Another useful command is `sort`, which as you may guess, allows us to sort the lines of a stream of data:

```{bash}
sort positions10.txt
```

Notice that the name of the column `position` is also part of the output. But what if we just want to play with the positions values, excluding the column name?

We can use `tail +2` to exclude the first value (i.e. the column name) . To do this with the column of positions, we must use the pipe operator `|` that enables us to take the output of a command and send it as the input of another command:

```{bash}
cut -d "," -f 3 data10.csv | tail +2
```

Now let's mix `|` and `>` to rebuild `positions10.txt` without the column name:

```{bash}
# positions (second attempt)
cut -d "," -f 3 data10.csv | tail +2 > positions10.txt

cat positions10.txt
```

Let's go back to the sorting operation:

```{bash}
sort positions10.txt
```


### Listing unique occurrences with `sort -u`

What if we want to list only the unique values (i.e. the unique categories)? 
`sort` has the flag `-u` to display only the unique occurrences:

```{bash}
sort -u positions10.txt
```


### Counting unique occurrences with `sort` and `uniq`

And what if we want the counts of those unique values (i.e. the frequencies)? To find the answer we pipe the output of `sort` as the input of the command `uniq` with the flag `-c`. Here's the entire pipe: 

```{bash}
sort positions10.txt | uniq -c
```

Now, let's apply it on the entire data file, step by step:

```{bash}
# select column of positions (excluding column name)
cut -d "," -f 3 nba2017-players.csv | tail +2 > positions.txt

# get position frequencies
sort positions.txt | uniq -c
```


### All in one pipeline

Finally, let's pipe all the commands in a single line, without creating the intermediate file `positions10.txt`:

```{bash}
# count unique position values, in a single pipe
cut -d "," -f 3 nba2017-players.csv | tail +2 | sort | uniq -c
```


### More examples

What if you want to do the same but now for the teams? In other words, count the number of players in each team?

```{bash}
# count unique team values, i.e. number of players
cut -d "," -f 2 nba2017-players.csv | tail +2 | sort | uniq -c
```

Find the minimum age (6th column)

```{bash}
# minimum age
cut -d "," -f 6 nba2017-players.csv | tail +2 | sort | head -n 1
```

Find the maximum age (6th column)

```{bash}
# maximum age
cut -d "," -f 6 nba2017-players.csv | tail +2 | sort -r | head -n 1
```

Frequencies of ages:

```{bash}
# age frequencies
cut -d "," -f 6 nba2017-players.csv | tail +2 | sort | uniq -c
```

# Filters

In the above examples we use a set of commands that are formally known as __filters__:

- `sort`
- `cut`
- `uniq`
- _etc_ (there are more filters)

Filters are a particular type of unix program that expects to work either with file redirection or as a part of a pipeline. These programs read input from standard input, write output to standard output, and often don't have any starting arguments.  


## Extracting columns with `cut`

When working with files that have a tabular structure (e.g. csv, tsv, field delimited) it is very common to focus on one or more "columns". To pull vertical columns from a file, you can use the `cut` command.

`cut` operates based either on character position within the column when using the `-c` flag, or on delimited fields when using the `-f` flag. By default, `cut` expects tabs as the delimiter. If a file separates fields with spaces or commas or any other delimiter, you need to use the option `-d` indicating the character used as field delimiter between quote marks.

| Option    | Description                                        |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
|  `-f` 1,5 | return columns 1 and 5, delimited by tabs.         |
|  `-f` 1,5 | return columns 1 through 5, delimited by tabs.     |
|  `-d ","` | use commans as the delimiters.                     |
|  `-c 2-7` | return characters 2 through 7 from the file.       |


```bash
# return columns 1 and 3 (tsv file)
cut -f 1,3 data.tsv
```

```bash
# return columns 2 and 5 (tsv file)
cut -f 2-5 data.tsv
```

```bash
# return columns 1 and 3 (csv file)
cut -f 1,3 -d "," data.csv
```

```bash
# return characters 1 through 6 (fixed-width format file)
cut -c 1-6 data.dat
```

## Sorting lines with `sort`

The output stream produced by many commands, as well as the lines of a file or of a series of files, can be sorted into alphabetical order with the `sort` command. In other words, `sort` reads information and sorts it alphabetically. You can customize the behavior of `sort` to ignore the case of words, and to reverse the order of a sort. This command also enables you to sort lists of numbers. The table below shows some of the common options for the `sort` command: 

| Option | Description                                          |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
|  `-n`  | sort in numerical order rather than alphabetically.  |
|  `-r`  | sort in reverse order, z to a or decreasing numbers. |
|  `-f`  | fold uppercase into lowercase (i.e. ignore case).    |
|  `-u`  | return a unique representative of repeated items.    |
|  `-k 3`| sort lines based on column 3 (tab or space delimiters) |
|  `-t ","` | use commas for delimiters.                      |
|  `-b`  | ignore leading blanks.                               |
|  `-d`  | sort in dictionary order.                            |

## Isolating unique lines with `uniq`

Another useful command for extracting a subset of values from a file, or summarizing a stream of text, is `uniq`. This command removes consecutive identical lines from a file, leaving one unique representative. More precisely, what `uniq` does is compare each line it reads with the previous line. If the lines are the same, `uniq` does not list the second line. You can use options with `uniq` to get more specific results:

| Option  | Description                                        |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
|  `-c`   | adds a count of how many times each line occurred. |
|  `-u`   | lists only lines that are not repeated.            |
|  `-d`   | lists only lines that are duplicated.              |
|  `-i`   | ignore case when determining uniqueness            |
|  `-f 4` | ignore the first 4 fields (space delimiter)        |

To get a single representative of each unique line from the entire file, in most cases you would need to first sort the lines with the `sort` command to group matching lines together. Interestingly, `uniq` can be used with the flag `-c` to count the number of occurrences of a line. This gives a quick way, for example, to assess the frequencies of values in a given column.
